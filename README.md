## 💡 Features

- 🔍 Input any movie title and get top 30 similar movie recommendations  
- 🧠 NLP-powered content-based filtering using TF-IDF  
- 🖥️ Streamlit-based web interface for clean interaction

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization** is applied on the movie overviews to convert text into numerical vectors.  
2. **Cosine Similarity** is used to find how close each movie is to the others.  
3. When a user inputs a movie title, the app finds it in the dataset and returns the top 30 most similar titles based on content.
